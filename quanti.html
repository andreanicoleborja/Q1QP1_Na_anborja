                    <p>The mean of the dataset is 28,286.1625. The median is 26,160.5. The Standard Deviation is 13,846.6 while the median is 26,160.5
                    The most appropriate to report is the median because the data is asymmetrical according to its skewness that is why we can interpret that the average number of students in the top 80 universities in the world is 26,160.5. The majority of students are in the range of 18,955-27,313. There is only one outlier observed. The universities in this dataset have student populations that vary significantly, from relatively small to quite large.

The shape of distribution of the number of students is symmetric and double-peaked. An IQR of 18,851 is relatively large, which suggests that there is a significant variation in the number of students among the top 80 universities. Some universities may have many more students, while others have fewer, leading to this considerable spread in the dataset.

The most appropriate to report is the mean because the data is symmetrical according to its skewness. The standard deviation of 13.3 for your research scores means that most scores are close to the average (76.38), but some scores are a bit higher or lower. It shows that there is a moderate amount of variation in your data. Most research scores of the top 80 universities are in the 70.2-76.1 range.There are no outliers observed.</p>
